﻿The Lithium JUnit plugin provides JUnit formatted test output for consumption by other tools, such as the Hudson Continuous Integration server.

To return JUnit over HTTP, specify the reporter and format, for example, as follows:

`http://example.com/test/app/cases/models/UserTest?reporter=junit&format=xml`

Currently, the plugin overrides the output of `li3 test` with the bastard child of the default console output and junit output. This situation will hopefully improve shortly.
